# Project Instructions

## Frontend Development

### Component Organization
- **Prefer component extraction over large files**: When working with React components in the `frontend/` directory, refactor components into their own separate files rather than keeping everything in a single large root file.
- Keep components modular and maintainable by splitting them into individual files when they become substantial or reusable.
